	Submission check passed. 

	Please ensure that you submit all source files in the submission directory:
	    - Makefile
	    - d2q9-bgk.c
	    - env.sh
	    - Any other files needed to build that you've added, e.g. OpenCL kernel files.

	Please also submit your report with the filename 'report.pdf'.

	Note: Your code has NOT been run and this does NOT mean that the results validate. You should check correctness separately.
